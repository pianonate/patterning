- KeyHandler in progress - notice that what you did with ControlKeyCallback may also apply to the Control hierarchy and make it simpler to understand and change - especially with all the complex generics used in the builder pattern

Yes, you are correct that both SimpleKeyCallback and ControlKeyCallback share the behavior of invoking a feature and returning a usage text, and this behavior is defined by the KeyCallback interface that they both implement.

However, the point of using the decorator pattern in this situation is not about sharing common behavior, but about adding new behavior. ControlKeyCallback adds the ability to notify observers when a key is pressed, which is not a behavior provided by SimpleKeyCallback.

While ControlKeyCallback could inherit from SimpleKeyCallback and still provide the same functionality, using the decorator pattern provides additional benefits:

Flexibility: Using the decorator pattern allows you to add or change behaviors at runtime. This can make your code more adaptable to changing requirements.

Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): By using the decorator pattern, you are adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle, a key principle of SOLID design. The SimpleKeyCallback class is responsible for invoking a feature and returning a usage text, while the ControlKeyCallback class is responsible for notifying observers.

Avoiding Class Pollution: If you were to use inheritance and ControlKeyCallback inherits from SimpleKeyCallback, then every other class that also inherits from SimpleKeyCallback would have access to the observer-related methods, even if they don't use them. This can make your code harder to understand and maintain.

Composition Over Inheritance: The decorator pattern promotes composition over inheritance. By using composition, you can create more flexible and maintainable code because you're not tying your classes together in a rigid hierarchy. Instead, you're creating objects that have specific behaviors, which can be easily composed to create complex functionality.

So while you certainly could use inheritance in this situation, using the decorator pattern provides a more flexible and maintainable solution.
